## Setup

To use this boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add blockchain-React-Redux-boilerplate https://github.com/Schwartz10/blockchain-ReactRedux-boilerplate
git fetch blockchain-React-Redux-boilerplate
git merge blockchain-React-Redux-boilerplate/master
```

Why did we do that? Because every once in a while, `blockchain-React-Redux-boilerplate` may be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch blockchain-React-Redux-boilerplate
git merge blockchain-React-Redux-boilerplate/master
```
